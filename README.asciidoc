= Tearly: Tear apart TiddlyWiki for cache-friendliness

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

I just want to use TiddlyWiki as a new form of static blog. But everytime I
update the "blog", the user have to download megabytes of data. Awful!

With Tearly, the user still downloads megabytes of data
the first time they come to visit, but later updates only
apply a `diff` of pressure on the user -- only updated tiddlers
get downloaded, all other big ones (like "core",
or "KaTeX plugin" something) get reused from the browser cache. Great!

And, NPM SUCKS TO ASS! This plugin requires only a static server with
WebDAV support (only need `MKCOL`, `PUT`, `DELETE` methods). Guess what,
nginx will do!
