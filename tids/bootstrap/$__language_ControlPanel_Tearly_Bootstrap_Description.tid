On normal usage, Tearly will upload your changes to your server through WebDAV by `PUT` and `DELETE` methods to/on the same URL in the browser address bar. But before that, you need to bootstrap Tearly to your server --- tear apart the whole wiki to individual Tiddlers and upload them one by one via WebDAV by `PUT` and `MKCOL` methods.

Bootstrapping can also be used to recover previous errors --- by reuploading the whole wiki again.
